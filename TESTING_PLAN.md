# Testing Plan for Miner Module

## Objective
The objective of this testing plan is to verify the functionality of the miner module and the effectiveness of the scraping enhancements made to `miner_utils.py`.

## Pre-requisites
- User authorization to create a new wallet and hotkey.
- Installation of all necessary dependencies.
- Successful implementation of deduplication and description enhancement logic.

## Steps
1. **Create Wallet and Hotkey**: Upon receiving user authorization, create a new wallet and hotkey for testing purposes.
2. **Update Miner Command**: Update the miner module command with the new wallet credentials.
3. **Run Miner Module**: Execute the miner module to test the scraping enhancements.
4. **Verify Scraping Results**: Check the output to ensure that unique and relevant YouTube videos are being scraped based on validator queries.
5. **Check Deduplication**: Verify that the deduplication logic is effectively removing duplicate videos.
6. **Assess Description Enhancement**: Evaluate the quality of the video descriptions generated by the GPT-3 model.
7. **Monitor Miner Stability**: Ensure that the miner module runs successfully without errors after the implemented changes.
8. **Document Results**: Record the findings and prepare a report detailing the testing outcomes.

## Post-testing Actions
- If the tests are successful, prepare a pull request with the implemented changes for review.
- If issues are encountered, perform debugging and necessary fixes before re-testing.

## Notes
- The testing environment should be isolated to prevent any impact on production systems.
- All tests should be thoroughly documented for traceability and review.
